# HomemadeMcpPanelWithArduino
Project repository which runs on computer and Arduino to communicate homemade MCP panel controls with the Flight Simulator program through FSUIPC library.

Special thanks to Arduino, CommandMessenger, MobiFlight for their great projects which helped me a lot while develoing my own MCP panel. I also used some of their code and libraries.
